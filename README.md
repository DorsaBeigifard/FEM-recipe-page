### What I learned
I recently took on this front-end coding challenge, using my shiny new HTML and CSS skills. It was like putting together a puzzle with all the pieces I'd learned. 

Exploring CSS Grid and Flexbox was surprisingly enjoyable â€“ it was like playing with virtual Legos! But then, ensuring everything looked sleek on various devices posed a new challenge. Working with media queries and embracing a mobile-first approach was a bit daunting at first, but I'm thrilled I took that route.

Along the way, I stumbled upon clamp() and discovered how it could enhance responsiveness. Integrating it with the vw unit allowed me to witness the webpage adapt seamlessly to dynamic resizing.

At the end, seeing everything come together was totally worth it!
I can't wait to learn more and do more challenging projects.
